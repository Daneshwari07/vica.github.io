### **Merchant Similarity Scoring**

---

Visa's merchant verification system must detect fraudulent clones and fake merchant entries.**Longest Common Subsequence**(LCS) can be used to apply on merchant names,address fields and transaction descriptions to compute similarity scores.Visa uses this during merchant onboarding,periodic audits and fraud detection pipelines.

- **Market Benefits:** Reduced merchant fraud,improved data integrity and trustworthy partner ecosystem.

- **Design techniques and Performance analysis:**
     - **Longest Common Subsequence:** Dynamic Programming
          - Time complexity : O(m*n) where m and n are lengths of subsequence
          - Space complexity: O(m*n) for storing the LCS table
