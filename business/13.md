### **Transaction History Analytics in VisaNet** 

---

Visa processes billions of transactions globally and each cardholder has a growing transaction history that needs to be stored,queried and analyzed efficiently.

**Persistent Segment tree** can be used to maintain historical versions of each user's transaction data. Instead of overwriting old data, a new version is created with each update which enables fast queries on past transaction states.This helps in fraud investigation and audit trails.

**Fenwick Tree** can be used to maintain and query cumulative transaction totals.Fenwick tree enables fast prefix sum calculations and dynamic updates as new tranactions occur.This makes it useful in real-time analytics.

- **Challenges**
     - Handling massive volumes of transactional data across global infrastructure
     - The solution must support high availability and dynamically scaled infrastructure as transaction volumes fluctuate globally.
     - Transaction anlytics must delivar the results under 100ms for smooth user experience in dashboards.

- **Market benefits :**
Real-Time Analytics, infrastructure efficiency,historical versioning supports regulation compliance,internal audits. It also improves user trust and engagement.

- **Design techniques and Performance analysis:**
     - **Persistant Segment tree**
          - Time Complexity:
             - Update: O(log n)
             - Query : O(log n)
          - Space Complexity:
             - O(log n) per version
     - **Fenwick Tree**
          - Time Complexity: It takes O(n) to build
             - Update: O(log n)
             - Query(Prefix Sum): O(log n)
          - Space Complexity: O(n)
