### **Routing Algorithms for Transaction Optimization**

---

**Dijkstra's Algorithm** can find the most cost-effective and fastest route for a transaction between the customer's bank and the merchant's bank,when multiple intermediaries are involved. considering factors such as network latency,currency exchange rates and real-time system load.

Floyd-Warshall Algorithm: In Visa's network **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm** can be used for network analysis.It helps to find the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes.It precomputes all possible router between banks and payment processors,enabling fast path selection during high transaction volumes without re-running pathfinding algorithms.

- **Challenges:** Computing shortest paths considering traffic and road conditions.

- **Market Benefits:** Faster transaction approvals,reduced processing costs,enhanced customer trust and better cross-border payment efficiency.

- **Design techniques and Performance analysis:**
     - **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Greedy approach, Priority queue
          - Time Complexity: O((V + E) log V) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges
          - Space Complexity: O(V) where V is the number of vertices<br>

     - **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:** Dynamic programming, All-pairs shortest path
          - Time Complexity: O(V<sup>3</sup>) where V is the number of vertices
          - Space Complexity: O(V<sup>2</sup>) where V is the number of vertices
