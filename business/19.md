### **Dispute Resolution Workflow Optimization in VisaNet**

---

Visa handles millions of transaction disputes globally through its robust dispute resolution system. Optimizing this workflow ensures faster, fairer handling of chargebacks and conflict cases.

**Topological Sort** can be used in the dispute resolution process where each node represent a specific task and edges represent dependencies between steps.Topological sorting ensures that tasks are excured in the correct sequence, respecting deadlines and dependencies.This avoids invalid processing and delays.

Stable Marriage Algorithm: **Stable Marriage Algorithm** can be used to ensure that agents are fairly and optimally assigned to cases based on skill sets,preferences or case complexity without conflicts or repeated reassignments.This helps balance workloads improve decision quality and enable faster resolution times.

- **Challenges:** Fair resource allocation,scalability issues.

- **Market Benefits:** Faster resolution time,Fair and efficient agent assignment and increased throughput and scalability.

- **Design techniques and Performance analysis:**
     - **Topological Sort** DFS based topological sort
          - Time complexity:O(V+E)
          - Space complexity:O(V+E) (for storing DAG)
     - **Stable Marriage Algorithm** use gale-shapley algorithm to find stable match
          - Time complexity:O(n<sup>2</sup>) where n is number of agents
          - Space complexity:O(n<sup>2</sup>)
