### **Risk Pattern Mining in VisaNet**

---

Visa processes millions of transaction records daily, many containing descriptions, merchant codes, or metadata. Fraudsters often embed subtle, repeated patterns in this text to disguise illegal activities.

Visa can scan transaction description, merchant category codes using fast string matching techniques. **Boyer-Moore** algorithm can be used to efficiently search through large volumes of transaction logs for known fraud patterns. By scanning from right to left and skipping ahead based on mismatched characters, it reduces unnecessary comparisons.

**Knuth-Morries-Pratt(KMP)** can be used to transaction descriptions in linear time without backtracking, This is useful for detecting fraud patterns that appear frequently but may be slightly modified in placement.

**Rabin-Karp** algorithm can be used to search multiple suspicious patterns at once by hashing each substring and comparing it with known fraud hashers.These techniques together help Visa to identify subtle and recurring fraud signatures across its global transaction stream.

- **Market Benefits:** Helps to prevent transaction laundering, synthetic ID fraud, and fake merchant campaigns

- **Design techniques and Performance analysis:**

     - **Boyer-Moore Algorithm:** uses bad character and good suffix heuristics
          - Time complexity: O(nxm) (worst-case pattern)
          - Space complexity: O(m+σ) where m is pattern length and σ is alphabet size/
     - **Knuth-Morris-Pratt:** uses prefix table
          - Time complexity: O(n+m) where n is text length, m is pattern length
          - Space complexity: O(m) prefix table
     - **Rabin Karp:** uses rolling hash
          - Time complexity:
              - Single pattern: avrage O(n+m) and worst case O(nm)
              - Multiple pattern: O(nxk) where k is the number of patterns
          - Space complexity: O(1) for single and O(k) for multiple patterns.
