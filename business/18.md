### **Global Payment Clustering**

---

Visa operates across regions with billions of transactions flowing through VisaNet daily. To analyze and optimize payment behavior across countries, industries or merchant types.Visa can be used **Union-Find** to dynamically group entities that share common traits such as merchant category, transaction location, payment processor.

- **Design techniques and Performance analysis:**
     - **Union-find Data structure**
          - Time complexity:
             - Find(x) : O(α(n)) α(n) is the inverse Ackermann function
             - Union(x,y) : O(α(n))
          - Space complexity: O(n) where n is the number of transactions or merchant entities
