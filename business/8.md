### 8. **Scheduling Tasks in data centers**

---

Visa's vast network of data centers relies on efficient task scheduling algorithms to manage computational workloads and optimize resource utilization.**Topological Sort** can be used to schedule tasks and dependencies in directed acyclic graphs(DAGs),ensuring that tasks are execution in the correct order to meet the deadlines,minimize latency and maximize throughput

**Challenges:** Efficient task scheduling and resource allocation.

**Market Benefits:** Improved resource utilization,minimized latency.

**Design techniques and Performance analysis:**
   - **Topological Sort:** Directed acyclic graph(DAG), Depth-first search(DFS)
        - Time complexity: O(V+E), where V is the number of vertices (tasks) and E is the number of edges (dependencies) in the DAG
        - Space Complexity: O(V + E) for storing the graph and additional structures
