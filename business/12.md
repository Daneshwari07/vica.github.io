### **Transaction Sequence Compression for AI Models**

---

Visa increasingly uses AI models for fraud detection,personalization and behavioral scoring.These models depend on clean, tokenized representations of transaction sequences.
**Suffix Trees** can be used for indexing and compressing repeated subsequences in large transaction logs making it more efficient for pattern mining and anomaly detection.
**Tries and Skiplis** can also be used for transaction sequence compression.

- **Design techniques and Performance analysis:**
     - **Suffix Tree**
          - Time complexity:
             - Build : O(n) using ukkonen's algorithm
             - Search: O(m) where m is length of pattern
          - Space complexity: O(n)
