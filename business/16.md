### **Cross-Merchant Fraud Detection in VisaNet**

---

In financial fraud some merchants may collude to launder money or distribute fraudulent transactions across multiple accounts and terminals.These merchants might pass fake transactions among themselves, creating cyclic patterns that are difficult to detect with linear or rule-based systems. 

Visa can be used **Kosaraju's** or **Tarjan** to detect strongly connected components(SCC) in the network.An SCC is a group of merchants where every merchant is reachable from every other, signaling tight interconnection.

- **Market Benefits:** It strengthens anti-money laundering and fraud intelligence systmes.

- **Design techniques and Performance analysis:**
     - **Kosaraju's Algorithm:** Two-phase DFS (original and transposed graph)
          - Time complexity: O(V+E)
          - Space complexity: O(V)
