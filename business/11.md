### **Transaction Data Compression & Storage**

---

Visa handles enormous volumes of transaction logs daily so it requires efficient storage and transmission.
Visa can be used **Huffman Coading** to efficiently compress transaction metadata,log files by assigning shorter binary codes to frequently occuring values. This reduces the size of logs before storing or transmittting them across data centers.It also reduces data storage cost and improves retrival times.

**Lempel-Ziv algorithms** can be used for compressing trasaction streams that exhibit repeated patterns such as recurring location codes, currency formats.Using LZ based compression in real-time logging system to detect and eliminate redundancy and making it suitable for both storage and low latency transmission between systems.

**Run-Length Encoding** can be used to compress simpler analytics data with repetitive values such as status flags,transaction success/failure logs or time series data with constant intervals.It is a lightweight and effective for specific log formats where repeated vaues appear in long sequences.

- **Challenges**
 Real-time compression can add CPU and memory load when their is large or continuous data streams.It also increase response time in systems

- **Market benefits:**
Improved Scalibility,enables faster data movement between microservices and regional payment gateways.

- **Design techniques and Performance analysis:**
   - **Huffman coding**
        - Time complexity: 
           - Encoding: O(n log n)
           - Decoding: O(n)
        - Space complexity:O(n) for storing the Huffman tree and encoded data
         
  - **Lempel-Ziv**
       - Time complexity:
          - Encoding: O(n) (depends on match length)
          - Decoding: O(n)
       - Space complexity: O(n) 
         
  - **Run-Length Encoding**
       - Time complexity:
          - Encoding: O(n) (depends on match length)
          - Decoding: O(n)
       - Space complexity: O(1) to O(n) (depends on repetition)
