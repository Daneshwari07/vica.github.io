### 20.**Network Reliability using Bridges and Articulation Points**

---

In Visa, a millions of financial transactions occur every second fot that maintaining a reliable and fault-tolerant network is essential.The algorithms such as finding **bridges and articulation points** help identify critical points of failure in the network.By identifying these points, Visa can implement redundancy measures and optimize network design to minimize downtime and improve overall network reliability.

- **Challenges:** Challenges: Identifying critical points of failure in the network.

- **Market Benefits:** Improved network reliability, and minimized downtime.

- **Design techniques and Performance analysis:**
     - **Bridges and Articulation Points**
          - Time complexity: O(V+E)
          - Space complexity:
              - Bridges:O(V+E)
              - Articulation Points:O(V)
