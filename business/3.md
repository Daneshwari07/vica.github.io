### **Location-Based Risk Check**

---

Visa can be used **KD-Tree** to perform fast and efficient geo-location lookups during a transaction.It is tree structure used for storing spacial data.It quickly find the nearest known locations to the user's current point by breaking down the location space into a grid.If a new location is too far from previously known ones and time gap is short,the system can flag it as potential fraud risk.

- **challenges** Handling geographic coordinates and divice information efficiently,keeping location history updated for millions of users.

- **Market analysis** Improved fraud detection,faster transaction decisions,improves customer safety.

- **Design techniques and Performance analysis:**
     - **KD tree:**
          - Time complexity: O(n logn), where n is number of locations
             - Search Time: O(n) if tree is unbalanced
          - Space complexity: O(n) where n is number of stored points.
