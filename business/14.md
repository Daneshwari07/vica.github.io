### 14.**Detecting fraud in Financial transactions**

---

Visa builds behavioral models based on user's historical transaction patterns such as frequency,location,amount and merchant type.It can be use a **trie** to store known fraud card prefixes and merchant IDs based on past fraud.For every new transaction it checks the card number and merchant against this trie.Tries are fast at matching prefixes it can instantly find the fraud activity.

Hash Table: Visa can be used hash tables to store the hashed information like user devices,browser fingerprints, ip addresses and login sessions.Each of these identifiers is converted into a unique hash and stored in the system.when a new transaction is made,the system quickly checks wheather the hashed signature of the device matches the past trusted ones.If it doesn't match then the system block the transaction to prevent fraud.

**Challenges**
  - Fraud must be detected within milliseconds of the transaction request.
  - Visa handles tens of thousands of transactions per second, requiring high efficiency and accuracy.
  - Balancing fraud prevention without blocking authorized users.
---

**Market Benefits**
  - Early fraud detection can reduce financial losses, it increases trust of users and merchants.Authorized transactions runs smoothly and fraud ones are flagged seamlessly.

**Design techniques and Performance analysis:**

   - **Trie:** tree structure
       - Time complexity: O(m) where M is length of prefix
       - Space complexity: O(nxm)
         
   - **Hash Table:**
       - Time complexity: O(1) for retriving,searching data.
       - Space complexity: O(n)
