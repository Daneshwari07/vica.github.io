### **Card and BIN Resolution for Visa Transaction Routing**


---

Trie: **Trie** can be used to quickly match the card's BIN prefix by checking each digit step-by step,it following a path through a tree.This makes it very fast to identify the issuing bank or country based on the card number's first few digits.

Hash Tables: **Hash tables** can be used in session and profile storage.It helps Visa to store and retrieve the user session data and card information with near instant access.This ensures quick verification during transactions.

skip list: **skip list** can be used in Dynamic card information updates,it handle frequent insertions,deletions and updates to active card records.By keeping the data sorted it ensures faster access.

- **challenge:** efficiently handling millions of card details

- **Market Benefits:** Faster card recognition during transactions,reduced transaction delays and improve user experience.

- **Design techniques and Performance analysis:**
     - **Tries** Tree data structure,prefix tree
          - Time complexity: O(L) for insertion,deletion and lookup operations,where L is the length of the key.
          - space complexity: O(ALPHABET_SIZE*L) where ALPHABET_SIZE is the number of possible characters

     - **Hash Table** 
          - Time complexity: O(1) for insert/delete/search
          - Space complexity: O(n) where n is number of stored items.

    - **Skip Lists** Probabilistic balancing,layered linked lists
         - Time complexity: O(log n) on average for search, insertion, and deletion, where n is the number of elements in the list
         - Space complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the skip list
