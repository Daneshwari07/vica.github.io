### 10.**Optimal Transaction Bundle for Offers**

---

Visa collaborates with merchants to offer personalized cashback, reward points and discounts.The challenge is to maximize user benefit by selecting the best combination of offers applicable to a userâ€™s transaction history and current context.

Visa can use **0-1 Knapsack** to select the best mix of rewards or cashback offers for a user within set limits like budget or offer count.This ensures the user receives the maximum possible benefit from eligible offers without violating any constraints. Visa can use **House Robber** algorithm which ensures time-sensitive or conflicting offers don't overlap. This personalization boosts user satisfaction and increases both merchant and card transaction volumes.

- **Market Benefits:** Improves user engagement,increased transaction volume and higher merchant conversion rates.

- **Design techniques and Performance analysis:**
  
     - **0-1 KnapSack Algorithm:** Dynamic Programming
          - Time complexity: O(n*W) where n is number of items and W is the maximum capacity(benefits)
          - Space complexity: O(n*W)
     - **House Robber:** Dynamic Programming
          - Time complexity: O(n)
          - Space complexity: O(1)
