  [1] Visa and various services 
</p>
<p>Visa, a global leader in digital payments, offers a secure transfer of funds across the world through its advanced financial network.These include VisaNet, Visa Direct,Contactless payments,Ecommerce payment solutions.Visa plays a key role in the future of financial technology,making it a great example of how algorithms and data structures can improve transaction speed,prevend fraud and create a better experience for customers at a global scale.</p>
The services provided by Visa include:
- **VisaNet** : Global payment processing network.
- **Visa Direct** : Real-time payment transfer.
- **Visa Cards** : Used for payments.
- **Contactless payments** : Tap-to pay transactions.
- **Fraud Protection**: Keeps card details safe.

### **VisaNet**
**VisaNet**, is the core global processing network of Visa.Approximately 65,000 card transactions per second are supported by VisaNet[2], which manages card transaction authorization, clearing, and settlement.It highlights the need of fast and efficient algorithms.

### **Visa-Direct**
**Visa-Direct**, supports real-time payments and is expected to help facilitate over $10 trillion in global money movement by 2026 [3].This highlights the need of root-optimized algorithms to handle data efficiently.

### 5.Network load balancing in VisaNet

VisaNet handles billions of real-time transactions daily across global data centers.It has multibal global data centers. **Segment Tree** can be used to store and update the aggregated transaction loads per region. This helps to quickly determine which region has capacity to handle more traffic.It updates load counters when transaction start or finish.

Hash Table: a **Hash Table** combined with consistent Hashing is used to efficiently assign transactions from millions of users to backend servers. This technique ensures that the load is evenly distributed, reducing the chance of overloading any single server. When servers are added or removed,only a minimal number of transaction mapping need to change.

### 6. Transaction Data Compression & Storage
Visa handles enormous volumes of transaction logs daily so it requires efficient storage and transmission.
Visa can be used **Huffman Coading** to efficiently compress transaction metadata,log files by assigning shorter binary codes to frequently occuring values. This reduces the size of logs before storing or transmittting them across data centers.It also reduces data storage cost and improves retrival times.

**Lempel-Ziv algorithms** can be used for compressing trasaction streams that exhibit repeated patterns such as recurring location codes, currency formats.Using LZ based compression in real-time logging system to detect and eliminate redundancy and making it suitable for both storage and low latency transmission between systems.

**Run-Length Encoding** can be used to compress simpler analytics data with repetitive values such as status flags,transaction success/failure logs or time series data with constant intervals.It is a lightweight and effective for specific log formats where repeated vaues appear in long sequences.

### 7.Transaction History Analytics in VisaNet 
Visa processes billions of transactions globally and each cardholder has a growing transaction history that needs to be stored,queried and analyzed efficiently.

**Persistent Segment tree** can be used to maintain historical versions of each user's transaction data. Instead of overwriting old data, a new version is created with each update which enables fast queries on past transaction states.This helps in fraud investigation and audit trails.

        - Space Complexity: O(n)


### 8. Secure Authentication & Encryption
In the world of digital payments,Visa ensures that every transaction is secure and authenticated.This is achieved through a combination of strong encryption,hashing techniques and optimized data structures that work together to protect sensitive information in real time.

**Fermat‚Äôs Little Theorem** plays a foundational role in RSA encryption, which is used by Visa to secure communication between users,banks and merchants.It enables the calculation of modular inverses and supports the integrity of public-private key operations used in digital signatures and secure handshakes. When creating public key two large prime numbers are chosen and multiplied together.Fermat's Little theorem assists in ensuring that these numbers have properties that make the encryption secure yet feasible to compute for those with the correct key[].The theorem aids in determining the modular inverse during the RSA key generation process which is also crucial for decrypting the received messages.
