  [1] Visa and various services 
</p>
<p>Visa, a global leader in digital payments, offers a secure transfer of funds across the world through its advanced financial network.These include VisaNet, Visa Direct,Contactless payments,Ecommerce payment solutions.Visa plays a key role in the future of financial technology,making it a great example of how algorithms and data structures can improve transaction speed,prevend fraud and create a better experience for customers at a global scale.</p>
The services provided by Visa include:
- **VisaNet** : Global payment processing network.
- **Visa Direct** : Real-time payment transfer.
- **Visa Cards** : Used for payments.
- **Contactless payments** : Tap-to pay transactions.
- **Fraud Protection**: Keeps card details safe.

### **VisaNet**
**VisaNet**, is the core global processing network of Visa.Approximately 65,000 card transactions per second are supported by VisaNet[2], which manages card transaction authorization, clearing, and settlement.It highlights the need of fast and efficient algorithms.

### **Visa-Direct**
**Visa-Direct**, supports real-time payments and is expected to help facilitate over $10 trillion in global money movement by 2026 [3].This highlights the need of root-optimized algorithms to handle data efficiently.

### **Tap-to-Pay**
**Tap-to-pay**, now account for more than 50% of Visa face-to-face transactions globally as of 2023 [4].This rapid tap-to-pay growth highlights the need for ultra-fast, low-latency algorithms that enable instant transaction validation and tokenized security.

## Enhancing Visa's Services with Algorithms
In today‚Äôs digital age, the efficiency and effectiveness of financial technology services can be significantly enhanced through the strategic application of data structures and algorithms. This portfolio project explores the core functionalities of Visa‚Äôs global payment systems, applying the theoretical knowledge and practical skills acquired from courses in **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** and **Algorithmic Problem Solving (APS)**. By using advanced algorithmic techniques and innovative data structures, this project aims to propose solutions to real-world challenges.

This portfolio demostrates how algorithms make Visa's services more efficient, including transaction optimization, fraud detection, real-time payment routing, and system scalability within Visa‚Äôs environment.

### 1. **Card and BIN Resolution for Visa Transaction Routing**
Trie: **Trie** can be used to quickly match the card's BIN prefix by checking each digit step-by step,it following a path through a tree.This makes it very fast to identify the issuing bank or country based on the card number's first few digits.

Hash Tables: **Hash tables** can be used in session and profile storage.It helps Visa to store and retrieve the user session data and card information with near instant access.This ensures quick verification during transactions.

skip list: **skip list** can be used in Dynamic card information updates,it handle frequent insertions,deletions and updates to active card records.By keeping the data sorted it ensures faster access.

### 1.**Routing Algorithms for Transaction Optimization**
**Dijkstra's Algorithm** can find the most cost-effective and fastest route for a transaction between the customer's bank and the merchant's bank,when multiple intermediaries are involved. considering factors such as network latency,currency exchange rates and real-time system load.

  <br>
</p><br>

Floyd-Warshall Algorithm: In Visa's network **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm** can be used for network analysis.It helps to find the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes.It precomputes all possible router between banks and payment processors,enabling fast path selection during high transaction volumes without re-running pathfinding algorithms.

**Challenges:** Computing shortest paths considering traffic and road conditions.

**Market Benefits:** Faster transaction approvals,reduced processing costs,enhanced customer trust and better cross-border payment efficiency.

**Design techniques and Performance analysis:**
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Greedy approach, Priority queue
  - Time Complexity: O((V + E) log V) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges
  - Space Complexity: O(V) where V is the number of vertices<br>

- **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:** Dynamic programming, All-pairs shortest path
  - Time Complexity: O(V<sup>3</sup>) where V is the number of vertices
  - Space Complexity: O(V<sup>2</sup>) where V is the number of vertices
